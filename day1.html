        <h3>Database Management System</h3>
        <p>A Database Management System (DBMS) is a software application that interacts with end-users, applications, and 
             the database itself to capture and analyze data.The primary purpose of a DBMS is to provide a systematic and 
             organized way of creating, retrieving, updating, and managing data.</p>
        <h3>Data</h3>
        <p> Data is the raw, unprocessed collection of facts and figures that form the basis for information. 
            In a database context, data refers to the individual pieces of information that are stored in tables,
            such as numbers, text, dates, and multimedia files. Data can be structured, like entries in a spreadsheet,
            or unstructured, like text documents and images.</p>

            <h3>Information</h3>
                <p>Information is data that has been processed, organized, or structured in a way that provides context and meaning.
                   Within a DBMS, information is derived from data by running queries, performing calculations, and generating reports, 
                   which help users make informed decisions based on the analyzed data.</p>

            <h3>Metadata</h3>
                 <p>Metadata is data about data. It describes the structure, operations, and constraints of data stored within a database,
                    providing context and meaning. Examples include schema definitions, data types, constraints, and relationships between tables.
                    Metadata helps in data management and retrieval by providing essential information about the data's organization and usage.</p>

             <h3>Data Dictionary</h3>
                 <p>A data dictionary is a centralized repository of metadata containing detailed information about the database's structure,
                    including tables, fields, data types, constraints, and relationships. It serves as a reference for database administrators
                    and developers, ensuring consistency and understanding of the database's design and facilitating effective data management.</p>

             <h3>Database</h3>
<p>A database is an organized collection of structured data, typically stored and accessed electronically from a computer system. 
A DBMS manages and interacts with the database, allowing users to perform operations such as data insertion, querying, updating, 
and deletion. Databases are essential for storing vast amounts of data in a structured manner, ensuring efficient retrieval and 
manipulation.</p>

<h3>Table</h3>
<p>A table is a collection of related data entries organized in rows and columns within a database. 
Each table represents an entity, such as customers or orders, with columns defining the attributes 
of the entity and rows representing individual records. Tables are fundamental components of a relational database, 
allowing structured data storage and efficient querying.</p>

<h3>Tuple</h3>
A tuple, also known as a row or record, is a single entry in a table. It represents a single data item, with each column 
in the tuple corresponding to a specific attribute of the data entity. In a customer table, for example, a tuple might contain 
the information for one customer, including their name, address, and contact details.</p>

<h3>Field</h3>
<p>A field, also known as a column or attribute, is a single piece of data within a table. Each field corresponds to a 
specific attribute of the entity represented by the table. For instance, in a table storing customer information, 
fields might include customer ID, name, email, and phone number. Fields define the data type and constraints for the 
values they can hold.</p>

<h3>Domain</h3>
<p>A domain defines the permissible set of values for a given field or attribute in a database. It establishes rules for 
the type, format, and range of data that can be entered into a field. For example, the domain for a birthdate field might 
require values to be in a date format and within a specific range of years.</p>

<h3>Constraint</h3>
<p>A constraint is a rule applied to database fields to ensure data integrity and consistency. Constraints restrict the type 
of data that can be inserted into a table, enforcing conditions such as uniqueness, non-null values, and valid references 
between tables. Common constraints include primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints, and check constraints.</p>

<h3>Key</h3>
<p>A key is a field or a combination of fields that uniquely identifies a record in a table. Keys are essential for 
establishing relationships between tables and ensuring data integrity. A primary key uniquely identifies each record 
within a table, while a foreign key is used to link records between tables, establishing relationships and enforcing 
referential integrity</p>
